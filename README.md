# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


The Smart Event Management Portal is a web-based application designed to digitize and streamline the complete lifecycle of colle<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (24)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc126ac-1c42-42c1-86f4-cbd0eb65fad5" />
ge events such as seminars, workshops, symposiums, and technical fests. Traditional event management in many institutions relies heavily on manual registration, physical attendance sheets, and time-consuming certificate distribution, which often leads to errors, inefficiencies, and poor data tracking.

This project provides a centralized digital platform where event organizers can announce events, manage registrations, track participation using QR-based attendance, and automatically generate certificates — all within a single system.<img width="1366" height="768" alt="Screenshot (22)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e20e249-8588-43b2-bd3b-117babde29eb" />
